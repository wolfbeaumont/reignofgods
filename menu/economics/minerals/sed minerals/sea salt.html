<hr>
&nbsp Formed by compressed sediment, and boiled from the brackish water of the sea, it is used in curing and food preparation. And can be used for payment as well due to itâ€™s rarity/difficulty to acquire, it is one of the finer salts. Salt is a necessary ingredient in staple diets where meat is scarce.
