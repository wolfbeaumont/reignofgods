<hr>
&nbsp Formed by compressed sediment and boiled from the brackish water of marshes, it is used in curing and food preparation. It can be used for payment as well due to itâ€™s difficulty to acquire and it is one of the finer salts. Salt is a necessary ingredient in staple diets where meat is scarce.
