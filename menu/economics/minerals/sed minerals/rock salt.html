<hr>
&nbsp Formed by compressed sediment, it is quarried from vast, dried up water-beds whether by receded seas, dried up lakes or cave systems. Used in curing and food preparation it can also be used for payment as well due to its difficulty to acquire. It is one of the finer salts and is a necessary ingredient in staple diets where meat is scarce.
