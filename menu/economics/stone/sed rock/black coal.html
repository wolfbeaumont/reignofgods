<b><u>Black Coal</b></u>
</center>
<hr>
&nbsp Formed by compressed sediment, it is a sooty-black rock that burns slower and hotter than charcoal which makes it a better forge fuel as well as a heating source in general. The only downside of black coal is that it is not as accessible as charcoal. It is found from mining, cliffs and washed up on shores. All coal is used to make Coke, much like Charcoal.
