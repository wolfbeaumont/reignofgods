<b><u>Limestone</b></u>
</center>
<hr>
&nbsp Formed by compressed sediment, it is a very heavy and fairly rare bedrock. Limestone has little resistance to acidic solutions and a millennia of rain will wear it down considerably. Most cave systems begin with passages through limestone bedrock. This light grey rock is a popular building material.
