<b><u>The Age of Souls</b></u>
</center>
<hr>
&nbsp The Age of Souls began with the creation of Atem, the first melding of its kind between a norn and a nuvian. We know little of this time, save what information has been gleaned from the norns, the nu and Atem itself. We know that the birth of Atem emptied the crystal elemental sphere of all it's remaining qi, yet it was eons before the shrivatsa would begin another purge. In this prison of possibility, Atem waited and planned.
<p>
&nbsp When the purge came Atem used all it's strength to hold the yggdrasil together, that they might absorb as much qi as possible. At the last moment, Atem allowed the yggdrasil to shatter, the crystal elemental sphere rupturing at it's core, its reality crashing into another, that of the stone elemental sphere. This violent union of crystal and stone blended into the first age of Wyrd's history. As these worlds collided, Atem escaped into the Aeon's prime dimension - using all of its newfound energy to weave Atem's existence into all of the remaining elemental spheres. What would become, in essence, an Underworld where both excess qi and unbound souls would be inexorably drawn.
<p>
&nbsp Atem's actions echoed through the remaining elemental spheres' realities, the norn protectors of each - horrified by the anomaly within their midst. Each of them, save one, turned on Atem and sought to destroy it, no matter the cost. Thus they began to try and destroy Aeon itself, as an immune system might attack the body when it has an infection. The one norn who did not turn on Atem was Dvallin, the stone norn and protector of this new amalgamated reality, Wyrd. Dvallin saw Atem for what it represented, a chance to escape the eternal cycle of the aeon and the nu, and so she turned against her sister norns.
