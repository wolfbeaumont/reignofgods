<b><u>The Serpent Sea</b></u>
</center>
<hr>
&nbsp The Serpent Sea is a massive tectonic shelf enclosed by an underwater mountainous range of magical coral reefs thanks to the Hiruku. These reefs result in great tidal waves that crash down onto terrific currents. This makes it all but impossible to escape the Serpent Sea for those who unfortunately find themselves trapped inside.
<p>
&nbsp The reef is known as Okami’s Roar and the warm currents passing into the Serpent Sea as well as the cold temperatures of the air result in near-constant thunderstorms close to the reef, receding in intensity the closer they get to the continent of Midgard until at last, they dissipate. The great tidal waves of the reef are also sometimes called the Kingtide and high in the clouds above, storm giants can sometimes be seen in the cloud breaks roaring challenges to one another, the remnants of the ancient Storm Wars.
<p>
&nbsp The Serpent Sea gets its name from the Ikujii that infest these waters, the waters littered with sunken wrecks as a testament to their danger. Few dare to sail far from the shores of Midgard, save perhaps the Brethren of Fadirrök who are even rumoured to be capable of sailing through Okami’s Roar.
