Natural Landmarks
        Pale Mountains
Nestling and elevating Sorrowfell’s Old City district, these heavily snowclad mountains feed the Mournsong River.
Barrows
Said to be the graves of jotunn long gone, Mournheim is littered with them, often appearing in clusters.
Mournsong River
A tributary of the Gullwyrm River, it flows swiftly cutting a narrow but deep gorge through the otherwise serene vales till it reaches the sea.
Barrowbrook River
Marking a natural border for much of the hold, this tributary of the Mournsong River is a gentler cousin, snaking through the Forest of Fagall towards the sea.
Forest of Fagall
Otherwise known as the Timid Woods, this forest breaks the Barrowbrook River’s borders extending across the southern lands of Mournheim into the eastern hold of Fjallheim. Fagall is named for its deathly silent nature where even the wind fears to breath.
Meadows of Vaen
Tucked between the hold’s rivers and the Forest of Fagall, these meadowed vales are steeped in fields of flowers, a feast of colours.
Graen Bay
A tranquil bay on the fringes of Sedna’s Eye, it is thick with forests of kelp and rich with shoals of fish.
Silver Isles
Found in Graen Bay, these islets are rich in silver veins. They are also well situated to defend the mouth of the Mournsong River.

Long before the Asgardians, another kingdom called the Horn home, a kingdom belonging to the Jotunn. Little is known of them, save that which can be gleaned from the glyphs left behind and the few rare encounters to be had with their nomadic descendants, north of Dvalinn's Bones.

Abandoned an age ago, the ruins of their great buildings still stand today, weathered blocks of local granite engraved with sagas forgotten to time and written in Aesiri, the language of the Svart. These ruins tower in comparison to even the largest of towns of Asgard today.

Strangely, the Jotunn seemed to have consigned themselves to the region now known as Mournheim, where the only city they had still stands. Asgardians know it as Sorrowfel, the City of Graves but the Jotunn city is further renowned as the graveyard of these giants, who practise burying their dead under mounds. It is said that the larger the mound, the greater the one buried beneath. As such, many refer to Mournheim as the 'Barrowlands'.

The capital of the hold, is built upon the ruins of the Jotunn city. What remains of the original architecture, points to a civilization of incredible craftsmanship and artistic beauty. Every surface, covered in engravings; patterns, script and pictures. It is commonly believed that the name Mournheim, came to be coined out of respect for the Asgardian's forebearers, this rings true for the capital itself, which is known as Sorrowfel, the City of Graves. Despite its grim facade, Mournheim is home to some of the finest mead in Asgard; some even claim that 'Widow's Mead', is brewed using the bones of Jotunn, however this is merely a misconception, due to the picking of a flower that grows on the barrow mounds, used in it's distilling, along with the cherry trees that grow wild throughout Mournheim.

On the northern coast, the barrows become easier to discern, stark mounds of sand, amidst the dunes of the bay's flat beachline. Further inland, time has hidden most of the mounds, to the point that no one knows just how many barrows are to be found in Mournheim, but it is generally considered a very hilly place. Oak and cherry trees for the most part dominant the region, separated by meadows of wild flowers and deep rivers of trout. Black bears and wolves are populous in the region, believed by many to have been the pets of the Jotunn themselves. What is known for sure, is that as beautiful as it is, Mournheim can be a dangerous place.
