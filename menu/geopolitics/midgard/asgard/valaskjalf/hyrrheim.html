Geography
Otherwise known as the Autumn Finger, the pleasant lands of Hÿrrheim (hear-hi-m) form the headland of the Great Horn. Marking the furthest point south of mainland Midgard and the furthest domain to stretch east of the nine kingdoms. The jagged coastlines have also often helped deter sea-raids from the Brethren of Fadirrök and the Raijin Empire. As such Hÿrrheim has become a place of rare solace and sanctuary, despite its apparent vulnerabilities.

Weather & Climate
Hÿrrheim’s climate experiences extremes of hot and cold, often resulting in severe weather. With cold air sweeping down from the northern darkness encountering the warm current of Okami’s Roar, resulting in hot summers and cold winters. This results in frequent thunderstorms during the summer years.

Spring Years
Colloquially known as the ‘Maple Years’ by locals, immigrants flock to Hÿrrheim during this period for the harvesting work, tapping maple trees for their syrup which results in the region’s largest exports. The years are temperate with frequent rains, and quick growth and subsequent harvest cycles for a variety of crops.

Summer Years
Colloquially known as the ‘Thundering Years’  by locals, frequent thunderstorms rage across the landscape - often resulting in wildfires which tend to be put out quickly enough by ensuing rains, though such fires have been known to burn for many days.

Autumn Years
Colloquially known as the ‘Brining Years’ or just the ‘Brining’ for much of Midgard. It is a time when the peoples are focused on building food-stocks for the coming winter years. These years are typically quite windy, and the weather changes quickly between hot and cold.

Winter Years
Colloquially known as the ‘Snow Years’ by locals, it is a time of increasing hardship, with few crops growing and a heavy reliance on hunting. Winter storms have been known to wipe out entire villages overnight, and snowfall is frequent, with those unaccustomed to heavy snowfall, easily becoming lost in the wilds.

Natural Landmarks

Bight of Crows
Tall and steep jagged cliffs line most of the coast with the northern face known as the Bight of Crows, where notoriously treacherous waters are filled with sharp rocks typically hidden just below the surface. Many-a-ship have been sunk here by storms, the bodies of tired and broken sailors left washed upon the rocks as the feasts of crows. Hidden between these sharp cliffs are small and difficult to reach inlets that are secluded and well suited for local harbours.

Blue Mountains
A range of small snow-capped mountains stretch across the heartlands of this hold, their pale peaks are often crowned in wreaths of clouds enceinte with rain. These mountains are rich in coal and limestone which gives them a pale countenance. The mountains take their name from a famous rare blue amber sometimes found in its coal veins. The Blue Mountains stretch west along the Fjall River’s northern shores as far as the fork of Raven’s Brook. It can be crossed at Rune’s Ridge on foot or via ferry.

Bylgja
One of the Daughters of Ran, this island is largely home to a bustling trade settlement. Close enough to hold’s capital, Axum, to sail there and back in a day - it is the ideal trading port for the hold given the dangers of sailing too deep into the Maw, with local sailors moving goods to the mainland from there. With a variety of reefs in the region, there is a thriving fishing industry thanks to the Graen Bay kelp nurseries, with shoals of mature fish having left its safety. On its southern coastline, a variety of birds make their home by the many thousands, hunting in the rich waters nearby. 

Forests of Aldrnari
Also known as the Pyrrwoods, this predominantly maple tree forest covers almost all of the hold, filling it with rich colours year-round. Considered a great marvel to behold across the nine kingdoms, these forests are the source of the renowned ‘Maple Mead’ which is brewed in the hold.

Halsgjá’s Throat
This is a gio that cuts a steep, cliffed inlet without any beaches, several hundred yards deep with a thin entrance only a few dozen yards wide. This naturally protected inlet opens up to a more spherical harbour once inside, with several impressively sized sea caves and the cliffs that stretch up a few hundred yards. Whilst it is not big enough to support a large port, it provides a means of trade and fishing for the city of Axum which is built around it.


A well-known salt farming community, it provides an important salt source in the region.

Architecture & Types of Buildings

Considered one of the Horn's most beautiful landscapes, the Autumn Finger, is named after the vast boreal forests of maple trees that cover it. The region is well known for it's logging industry, with Hÿrrheim's maple wood being some of the most valuable wood in Asgard.

It is however best known for its Maple Mead, considered by many to be the best mead in Midgard, though there are many challengers. Casks of Maple Mead have been found as far afield as Elderföll itself, and it is the hold's second largest export. During the spring years, many people travel to Hÿrrheim in the hope of work, given this is when the trees are drained of their sweet syrup.

There are, however, difficulties to be found in the hold. Dryads are a frequent problem, due to the encroachment of logging on their habitat, there are also populations of wolves and bears to contend with.

The capital of the hold is Axum (ache-sum) the Golden Axe, a small city by comparison to most hold capitals, with most of the population spread out across the Autumn Finger in villages and towns. The city sits close to one of the nine Deep Gates of Asgard. As such, it is a major trading hub with the Svartalfar.
