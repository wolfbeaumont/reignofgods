The hold centres itself around a lake, which the dwarves call the 'Well of Urd', and the numerous tributary rivers that spring from it across the kingdom. The lake is so deep it is said that much of its depth has never been fathomed. It is surrounded by a ring of mountains, save for a pass to the west, the source of the Silfwyrm River (the Silver Worm) and a natural arch, to the north, through the mountain range; the source of the Gullwyrm River (the Golden Worm). These two rivers are often referred to, as the 'Twin Serpents', or more off-handedly, as the 'Twins'. The mountain range surrounding the lake is known as the 'Ring of Draupnir', which takes it's name from the cave river that feeds the lake, from the east. This passage is also a Dwarven Gate and a highly profitable gold mine, both of which have turned the hold into an important trade centre.

The lake hosts a single island that has become a city, thanks to a large network of floating piers. Fortunately, the island's shallows have been extensive enough to accomodate the city's expansion. The city, and capital of the kingdom, is called Ringhorn, the Riverward. It takes the first half of its name from the mountains encompassing the lake, and the second half from the watchtowers, to the north and the west. A unique signal system of horn blows between the watchtowers and the city helps it keep aware of those approaching and their assessed intent. 

The southern and eastern mountains of the range are impassable, covered in snow; yet to the east, on the highest summit, can be seen the mysterious ruins of a spectacular citadel, often hidden by clouds and snow-storms. All but unreachable, they have remained untouched for thousands of years, even the dwarves are afraid of them, they call them the 'Ruins of Verdandi'; the stories say it was here that Dvalinn fought her sisters, freeing the dwarves from Norn's bondage. To protect her people, Dvalinn took them deep into the earth, through the mouth of Draupnir and taught them to forget the sky and the watching eyes of her sisters.

Ringhorn is at the heart of a vital passage for those wishing to avoid sailing around Valaskjalf, the cape of the horn. The Asgard use boats with a shallow draft to move easily along both the coast and the waterways. For those seeking to avoid the cape, it is a simple matter to sail north from the mouth of the Silfwyrm, or south from the mouth of the Gullwyrm. Together they provide passage through the horn, cutting days, if not a week under bad conditions, from a journey. However, to pass from the first to the second, one would have to sail through Ringhorn first.

Much of Eyanheim and indeed it's neighbouring Skogheim, is covered in a myriad of rivers and streams, amidst dense forestry, making land travel for a large group, practically impossible. As such, Ringhorn has protected the north of Breidablik from incursions to the south, just as the south has from the north. And so, passage through the twins has become both an important part of Asgardian trade, as well as its defense.

Ringhorn is the seat of power in Breidablik, where King Igor & Lady Eska hold court. Unlike other kingdoms, they have an unusual political system concerning Jarls. Due to Eyanheim being a small hold, it has no Jarl, or rather the reigning Lord or Lady, married to the Queen or King of the time, is Jarl of Eyanheim; whilst the Jarls of Skogheim are detailed in their own article.
