These three holds are more often referred to as the Wiskwoods of Breidablik, or just, the Wiskwoods. They share the second largest forest in Asgard, which is home to a wide variety of woodlands. From Oak to Elm, Pine to Alders, Willows to Hazels; the soil in the region is rich and fertile, fed by hundreds of rivers and streams steaming from Eyanheim and the Aurelian Mountains. Skogheim claims the region north of Eyanheim, east of the Gullwyrm River, whilst Vidheim holds the southern forests, east of the Silfwyrm; leaving the woodlands west of Eyanheim and the Twin Serpents to Laufheim which claims Breidablik's entire western border.

The Wiskwoods are renowned for being a dangerous place, home to many dryads, wargs and nanuk. To this end, the Jarls of the Wiskwoods established the Wardens, men and women of fortitude, bravery and stout morality to patrol the woodlands, moving from village to village, aiding them as they can. These Wardens are also empowered with judicial authority and they often dispense justice and settle disputes as necessary.

The Wardens of Breidablik are often held in higher regard than the Jarls themselves and to become one is a great honour. They are people who have sacrificed everything in service to their people. They are not paid for their services, and instead are treated as honoured guests wherever they go. Whilst Wardens can and do marry, due to their roaming lifestyle these men and women spend much of their time afar from their loved ones.

The northern hold of Skogheim, holds it's provincial capital on the Gullwyrm's estuary, which feeds into a fjord. On the mouth of the river, an island divides the waters in two, giving the island it's name - the Serpent's Tongue. The island is home to Fort Hjorr, a military garrison and a large town, burgeoning along the eastern bank of the estuary. The Fort protects Ringhorn from the Raijin Empire, should they ever attack. In such an event, the Gullwyrm would be the perfect way to enter the heartland of Asgard, swift and mercilessly, endangering all of the nine kingdoms.

The southern hold of Vidheim, holds its provincial capital, Solsbjorg, on the southern shores of Asgard, not far from the Silfwyrm's mouth. The town sits on the eastern bank of the Silfwyrm. A major port in Asgard, it is just west of the Tidemarsh. There is little in the way of military presence here thanks to Frostfjord in Valaskjalf, which has protected the southern coastline from the Raijin Empire's fleets for centuries.

Laufheim is landlocked, bordering the Twin Serpents and the Kingdom of Valaskjalf. It is a major conduit of trade between Ringhorn and Asbru, and as such, a major interior trading route for goods coming in and out of the neighbouring kingdom. It's provincial capital LÃ­mi, is a tree-town, built high up in the branches of the surrounding woodlands.
