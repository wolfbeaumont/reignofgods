Vingol is a region of interesting topography. Joined to the mainland via the 'Tidemarsh', it is a floodplain that becomes impassable on foot at high tides, whilst the larger hills and mountainous regions become veritable islands. Thankfully the waters of the Tidemarsh are deep enough for the keels of most ships. Characterised by two large island holds known as Hofnheim and Aftheim, there is also a smaller island called Maniheim and thousands of smaller islands and islets.

The Tidemarsh is fed by a multitude of rivers and aquifers coursing south from the Aurelian Mountains. Combined with the enormous power of the ocean tides that also flow into the eastern marshlands of Fensalir, the tides of the Serpent Sea flood the river warrens of Vingol breaking their banks, sweeping across the relatively flat plains of the region. The bedrock of the kingdom is exceptionally porous and vales can be found flooding and draining with rapid speed and ease, turning these into terrible traps for the unwitting.

Vingol is a wealthy state renowned for its shipwrights and gems.  The Kingdom's capital is Noatun, a city found in the hold of Maniheim. The city is especially noteworthy for being entirely underground. Deep inside a network of sea-caverns, the entirety of it is lit by a vast natural deposit of colourful moon crystals, the same lighting apparatus of the dwarves. It is in fact a vital commodity in the hold's trading partnerships. The caverns, which are a mixture of naturally occurring and mortal intervention, are huge spaces, supported by massive pillars in the sea that serve as a part of the city's real estate, each one hollowed into and surrounded by platforms and bridges. These pillars are known as masts. And serve as the richer districts of the city, which is otherwise built into the cavern walls closer to the waters of the sea. The entrance to Noatun resembles a great split in the side of the land, a chasm cutting into the otherwise serendipitous chalk cliffs. This grand singular entrance into the city is called the 'Dawn Gate', for at dawn and dusk the surrounding cliffs glow in the warmest lurid reddened-yellow tones.

The ships of Vingol are considered some of the best in Asgard and their reputation has given Vingol the distinguishing synonym of being called 'The Shipwright Isles'. Meanwhile the northern waters of the Tidemarsh offer the kingdom of Folkvang a tenuous coastal route, providing the two kingdoms with a strong partnership. Locals often make good money piloting ships from other kingdoms through the Tidemarsh given that the waters are known to shift daily thanks to the multitude of river warrens, never knowing which ones will break on a given day and as such the depth of the waters being sailed. Many ship graves can be found in the Tidemarsh, dark wardens in the misty waters.

Considered the trading capital of the nine kingdoms, Vingol also maintains luke-warm trading relations with various clans in the Raijin Empire. It is also plagued by smuggling both inside the kingdoms and with the Nine Bows. Fishing replaces herding in Vingol as the primary source of meat alongside the occasional farms and crops, which are typically imported.

The people of Vingol live in vibrant communities who, despite the treacherous waters that surround them, live by cultural philosophy of finding happiness wherever they can. The smallest of all the kingdoms, all islands and islets fall under the authority and protection of either Hofnheim, Aftheim and Maniheim's jarls.
