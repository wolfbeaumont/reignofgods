One of the Daughters of Ran, this island is largely home to a bustling trade settlement. Close enough to hold’s capital, Axum, to sail there and back in a day - it is the ideal trading port for the hold given the dangers of sailing too deep into the Maw, with local sailors moving goods to the mainland from there. With a variety of reefs in the region, there is a thriving fishing industry thanks to the Graen Bay kelp nurseries, with shoals of mature fish having left its safety. On its southern coastline, a variety of birds make their home by the many thousands, hunting in the rich waters nearby.
