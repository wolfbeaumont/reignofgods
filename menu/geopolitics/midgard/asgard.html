<hr>
&nbsp Asgard is divided into nine kingdoms, each home to a number of provincial holds. The rulers of these kingdoms bear the title King or Queen, whilst the provincial rulers of each hold are known as Jarls. Monarchs exist to judge disputes between jarls, to keep them in line and to protect the kingdom and its interests against any outside threats.
<p>
&nbsp The Asgard do not adhere to the concept of a hereditary monarchy, instead, they are a crowned republic with rulers elected from amongst the jarls of the kingdom. They rely upon the support of each jarl and in turn each jarl must rely upon the support of their karls who tend to be landowners, warriors and leaders of their own local respective communities. The title of Karl carries with it a great deal of respect but also the responsibility of providing work, sanctuary and protection to those within their communities. A jarl is chosen by the karls of each hold by consensus, just as a monarch is chosen by the jarls.
<p>
&nbsp Whilst there is no central authority over the nine kingdoms, no two kingdoms have ever gone to outright war before, though there are often economic disputes. The Kingdoms of Asgard have enough external threats to keep them largely allied to ensure the survival of all. To the east they face the threat of the slumbering Raijin Empire, where the Kajii view the asgardians as usurpers to their claim of sovereignty over all of Midgard. To the north, the hordes of Nunuk roam; attempting to invade Asgard, sacking and butchering all that cross their path. Then there are the Brethren of Fadirr√∂k, corsairs of the serpent sea that sail out from the uncharted Shadow Reefs, south of the Ikujii Archipelago. Until now, these threats have kept the nine kingdoms at peace with one another but there are also internal threats, especially given the majority of the nine kingdoms remain untouched by civilization; home to many creatures, benign and dangerous.
