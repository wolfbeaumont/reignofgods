<b><u>The Regions of Midgard</b></u>
</center>
A massive arctic continent, Midgard covers more than a quarter of the northern hemisphere, centring over Wyrd’s northern polar axis. Surrounded by the Serpent Sea, it is remote and cut off from the rest of the world thanks to a mountainous, magical reef that encompasses the Serpent Sea. This underwater pressure gives birth to Okami’s Roar, otherwise known as the Kingtide; powerful waves along the Serpent Sea’s rim that prevent escape by way of water from the continental shelf.
<p>
A submerged mountain range can be found just to the south of the continent, whose peaks today are divided into the islands of the Ikuji Archipelago and those of Shadow Reefs. The northern and central islands of this archipelago are claimed by the Raijin Empire. The southern islands of the Shadow Reefs are forever hidden in a haze of fog and left to the mysterious Hiruko and the devilish Brethren of Fadirrök.
<p>
West of the archipelago a peninsula curves south-east and is known as the Horn of Asgard. Divided into nine kingdoms, the denizens of these crowned republics call themselves the Asgardians. Deep beneath the Horn, its depths belong to the buried Svartan cities of old. The Horn is home to the southern tail of a vast mountain range called the Bones of Dvalinn which stretch across Midgard from the tide-marshes of Vingol to the ice floes of Eldrföll. The range cuts the asgardian peninsula off from the interior of Midgard save for the Pass of Anvil, high above the dark forests of Ydalir.
<p>
Little is known of the continent’s interior, allowing legends to fill the void, of which there are no shortage. What knowledge can be gleaned comes in piecemeal from Tuniit traders, nomadic Wargs and the rare pastoral Alfan. Such southern guests have given rise to stories about the vast forests of Myrkheim, the smoke valleys of Eikthyrn and the green steppes of Hefnharr. They speak of the barren wastes of Frostheim to the east, and the citadels of ice in the bays of Elderföll, beneath the Tears of Kagu, volcanoes ever weeping rivers of lava. Further north come whisperings of a city buried in ice beneath a night without end and a tree so tall it touches the stars themselves. It’s foliage an aurora borealis that can be seen by all, even as a faint glow upon the horizon beyond the Serpent Sea.
