<b><u>The Nu</b></u>
</center>
<hr>
&nbsp The Nu are beings of dark energy inside the Abyss. They hunt for and feed on celestial stars of living energy called the aeon. Once they pierce the core of these stars they breed, die and thus the cycle begins once again.
<p>
&nbsp The Nu live for countless millennia, feeding off the shrivatsa of an Aeon until they finally break through the defences and pierce an Aeon’s core. They then breed inside the dead star, extinguishing their existence in the effort to do so (much like salmon do). These newborn Nu then feed off the residual energies within the core until they are mature enough to go in search of more aeon.
<p>
&nbsp When an Aeon purges the energies of its shrivatsa, some Nu can penetrate the lattice’s interior, worming their way along the energy conduits in search of escape before the shrivatsa receives energy again (which kills any Nu caught inside its lattice). The lucky survivors that find a yggdrasil conduit to escape into become trapped inside the energy reservoirs of the yggdrasil’s elemental sphere. Once these spheres have been drained by the Nu inside them of all energy, the Nu will starve to death or be destroyed when the elemental sphere collapses during its next purge cycle.
<p>
&nbsp The Nu are primordial in their nature: they feed, they breed and they die. Whilst the Nu that become trapped inside the elemental spheres have been known to communicate in some basic form with certain denizens of these spheres, the intent they display exhibits a somewhat hive-minded approach, the sacrifice of the self in order for the Nu outside to get inside. Only one of the Nu has ever behaved differently.
