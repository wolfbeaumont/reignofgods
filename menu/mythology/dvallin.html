<hr>
&nbsp When the crystal elemental sphere shattered, its reality blending with the stone elemental sphere's, all the norns became aware of Atem's existence - the anomalous being from the merged essences of a norn and a nuvian. All of the norns turned on this being, driven like an immune system to attack the body to route out the disease, each of the norns began to work to destroy their own elemental spheres and ultimately the Aeon itself - eliminating Atem in the process. All of the norns except one.
<p>
&nbsp The norn of stone, Dvallin as she would come to be known, realized what Atem represented, how unique and important this new being was not just as an anomaly but as a way to preserve the Aeon for eternity. But as each elemental sphere was destroyed successively, she found herself caught in a growing war with her norn sisters until at last there were too many, and she fell. In part, they needed to kill Dvallin as each norn acts as a key to access the reservoir of each elemental sphere's core reservoir, but before they could the Baetylii, crystal elementals, stole her corpse and hid it such that the norns still look for the key to this day to bring about the end of Aeon and Atem.
