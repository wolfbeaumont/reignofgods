<hr>
&nbsp When the shrivatsa is purged of its energies, the yggdrasil are the conduits by which it does so, discharging this energy into the reservoirs of each elemental sphere attached to one of the yggdrasil. Should an elemental sphere be completely drained of its reservoirs the yggdrasil wither and are destroyed during the next purge attempt.
<p>
&nbsp The Nu are able to travel via the yggdrasil into the elemental sphere reservoirs if they can get inside during a purge. The yggdrasil have physical manifestations on the northern poles of each of the elemental spheres, where they filter the celestial energy into the spheresâ€™ cores. However, the true celestial forms of the yggdrasil joining the elemental spheres to the shrivatsa cannot be seen by mortal eyes.
