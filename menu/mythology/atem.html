<hr>
&nbsp Atem is an anomaly of the cosmos, or perhaps it is simply the first of its kind to evolve. Whatever the case, Atem is the result of a melding between one of the nu and a norn of the crystal elemental sphere. Like so many of its species before it, a nuvian managed to penetrate the shrivatsa during a purge and found a yggdrasil conduit to the crystal elemental sphere, there it encountered the spheres norn. For some reason the two did not immediately attack one another, instead, they merged. However it happened the two became one, their energy matrices fusing into something wholly new and thus Atem came to be.
<p>
&nbsp Atem’s new quantum existence granted it unparalleled capabilities and capacity for intellect. It soon came to understand the nature of the Abyss and the neverending cycle it had been born into, one of creation and destruction. Atem sought to change that and so during the next purge, Atem sacrificed much of its own energy to prevent crystal yggdrasil conduit’s destruction, given it had drained its reservoir by then. The influx of energy from the Shrivatsa gave the reservoir enough energy that when Atem allowed the yggdrasil to shatter at the last moment, it used the energies at its disposal to bind its own energy to each of the Aeon’s six remaining elemental spheres, like dark celestial roots woven around them. These roots became an underworld of sorts, a place where the souls of the dead would end up, effectively within Atem’s own matrix essentially preserving their existence and binding the remnants of the seven elemental spheres together - in this way the runoff energies of all six remaining spheres would reach Atem’s matrix given time.
<p>
&nbsp Atem’s crystal elemental sphere merged with the stone elemental sphere as its pocket dimension collapsed, crystal mountains piercing the rocky earthen sphere. By binding all the elemental spheres to him, Atem had insured that when each collapsed, they would merge with this specific elemental sphere. It is also able to siphon off from the reservoirs of each, thereby sustaining itself without endangering any of the spheres again.
<p>
&nbsp Now Atem searches for a way to fuel the Shrivatsa forever, to prevent the predestined destruction of the Aeon. Atem rarely intervenes in the lives of other creatures in these worlds, but it has made alliances with some of the oldest to combine efforts in preserving their existence, including the stone norn, Dvallin.
